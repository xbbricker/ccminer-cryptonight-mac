
It is advised to run ./autogen.sh before./configure (autoconf and automake
need to be installed on your system for autogen.sh to work)

./configure has an option named --with-cuda that allows you to specify
where your CUDA 5.5 toolkit is installed (usually /usr/local/cuda-5.5,
but some distros may have a different default location)

See README.txt
